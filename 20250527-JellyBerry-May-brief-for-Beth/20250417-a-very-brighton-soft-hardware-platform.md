# A Very Brighton Soft/Hardware Platform

- Version: 1
- Created: 27th May 2025 by Rich Plastow
- Based on notes from a call with Ian, 17th April 2025

> **Following a great call with Ian this morning, I think we’re pretty aligned on this project — it’s really exciting 😌**

---

## 1. What Are We Interested In?

* 🎛️ Fun little microcontroller projects
* 🤖 Making a cool product
* 💧 A robust, waterproof device for the home and outdoors
* 🌱 Ethical, eco, community
* 🚀 Doing a start-up together

---

> - ❌ Phones, desktop computers and smart-watches seem completely owned by
  the big tech companies…
> - ✅ …But bedside/tabletop devices (lamps and speakers), seems like a more open
  playing field

## 2. What Might Our Goals Be?

* 🧪 Have a little Brighton workshop for designing, moulding (resin, silicone),
   assembling the electronics, testing, and shipping
* 🌟 A growing product line of **small, fun, quirky devices:**
  * **Open hardware** (or semi-open)
  * **Open source software** (or semi-open)
  * **Handcrafted in small batches**
  * **Tough** and **waterproof**
  * **Customisable**
* 🛒 A website which sells the physical devices **and** has its own app store
* 👥 1000 customers who like quirky tech, in the first year
* 👩‍💻 After a few years, 3 or 4 full-time staff
* 🌐 A really active community of hackers/developers, building apps for
  JellyBerry's (curated) app store

## 4. The Concept

A **(semi) open hardware and software platform**. Small batches of
**one-off handcrafted devices.**

### Minimum Specification *(early models, smallest)*

* 💪 Rugged and completely waterproof/dustproof (has no external ports)
* 🔘 Four buttons on top
* 📱 Bluetooth connection to a smartphone app
* 🔌 internal USB port hidden inside, for development and debugging
* 🔊 Cheap internal loudspeaker
* ⚡ Wireless charging receiver, underneath
* 🔋 1 or 2 rechargeable batteries inside - users can swap these
* 🌈 360 individually addressable RGB LEDs sparkling near the surface
* 💡 6 nicely dimmable RGB LEDs, glowing deep inside
* 🧭 Gyroscope and accelerometer

### Additional Features - Midrange *(in year 2)*

* 🔵 Small circular touchscreen, for use **without a smartphone**.
* 📡 Wi-Fi in addition to Bluetooth
* 🔊 Better loudspeaker
* 🔋 3 or 4 batteries
* 🌈 720 individually addressable RGB LEDs near the surface
* 💡 12 dimmable RGB LEDs, deep inside
* 👁️ Light sensors

### Additional Features - Premium *(in a few years, biggest)*

* 🔵 Larger circular touchscreen
* 🔊 High quality loudspeaker, excellent bass
* ⚡ Wireless charging transmitter, for charging other devices
* 🔋 More batteries, for long battery life
* 🌈 1440 individually addressable RGB LEDs near the surface
* 💡 24 dimmable RGB LEDs, at different depths inside
* 🗣️ Microphone for voice-activation (security and privacy is a priority)
* 🌡️ Temperature and other sensors
* 💾 Internal (hidden) MicroSD card slot for local storage

## App Store

* 🆓 Some paid, some free, some freemium
* 🛠️ Some made by us, some by other devs (curated)
* 🧑‍💻 Some fully open source, some 'semi' open source

All app code and data passes through JellyBerry servers, so that we can block
insecure, malicious or inappropriate usage, and guarantee our users' privacy.
This may also lead to other revenue streams, because JellyBerry will be the
trusted source of server-side services like voice recognition and chat APIs.

> ⚠️ Users can opt-in to 'Jailbreak' mode, which allows a JellyBerry to run
> untrusted apps from outside the app store. Every JellyBerry has a hidden
> internal USB connector, which can be used to connect it to a computer running
> the JellyBerry command-line utility. This can then install apps from outside
> the app store. It's a **“Wild West”** of open-source apps — *“install on your
> device at your own peril!”*
