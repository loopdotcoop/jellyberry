# A Very Brighton Soft/Hardware Platform

**3 days' work, following our Friday 23rd call**

- Version: 1
- Created: 27th May 2025 by Rich Plastow
- Based on notes from a call with Ian, 17th April 2025

> Following a great call with Ian this morning, I think we’re pretty aligned on this project — it’s really exciting 😌

## 1. What Are We Interested In?

* 🎛️ Fun little microcontroller projects
* 🤖 Making a cool product
* 💧 A robust, waterproof device for the home
* 🌱 Ethical, eco, community
* 🚀 Doing a start-up together

> - ❌ Phones seem completely owned by big tech…
> - ❌ Smart-watches too…
> - ✅ But bedside/tabletop devices, seems like a more open playing field

## 2. What Might Our Goals Be?

* 🧪 Have a little Brighton workshop for moulding (resin, silicone), assembling
  the electronics, testing, designing and shipping
* 🌟 A growing product line of **small, fun, quirky devices:**
  * **Open hardware** (or semi-open)
  * **Open source software** (or semi-open)
  * **Handcrafted in small batches**
  * **Waterproof** and **Wireless charging**
  * **Customisable**
* 🛒 A website which sells the physical devices **and** has its own app store
* 👥 1000 customers who like quirky tech, in the first year
* 👩‍💻 After a few years, 3 or 4 full-time staff
* 🌐 A really active community of hackers/developers, building apps for the
  JellyBerry (curated) app store

## 4. The Concept

A **(semi) open hardware and software platform**. Small batches of
**one-off handcrafted devices**, which share a:

### Minimum Specification *(early models)*

* 🔘 Four buttons on top
* ⚡ Wireless charging underneath
* 📱 Bluetooth connection to a smartphone app
* 🌈 720 individually addressable RGB LEDs

### Midrange Features

* 🔵 Small circular touchscreen, for use **without a smartphone**.
* 📡 Wi-Fi in addition to Bluetooth
* 🔊 Basic internal loudspeaker
* 🌈 More LEDs!

### Premium Features *(in a few years)*

* 🔵 Larger circular touchscreen
* 🔊 High quality loudspeaker (security and privacy is a priority)
* 🗣️ Microphone, for voice-activation
* 💾 Internal (hidden) MicroSD card slot for local storage
* 🌈 Even more LEDs!!

---

## (Semi) Open Source App Store

* 🆓 Some free, some freemium
* 🛠️ Some made by us
* 🌐 Some by other devs (curated)
* ⚠️ It could also be good to allow apps from outside the app store to be
  installed, maybe by opening up a JellyBerry and setting it to 'Jailbreak'
  mode using its hidden internal USB connector. A **“Wild West”** of open-source
  apps — *“install on your device at your own peril!”*

---

### Bonus Ideas

* 🌞 Solar to wireless chargers
* 🌳 Devices hung from trees at festivals
